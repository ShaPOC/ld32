# LD32 [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

My Ludum Dare 32 game made with Phaser.io
You can play it here; http://iamlimitless.nl/ld/32/

It was my first attempt at using Phaser.io and coded within 48 hours, therefore it's far from finished.
Still, the mechanics are nice and I see myself finishing this in the future.
